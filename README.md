# Generative AI - Coursework Repository

This repository contains my coursework submissions for the **"Generative Artificial Intelligence"** class. It includes **5 homework assignments** and **1 final project**, covering core topics in generative AI such as clustering, association rules, CNNs, GANs, and LLMs.

## 🗂️ Contents

- HW1 - Clustering, Classification, and Association Rules  
- HW2 - CNN for Image Classification  
- HW3 - Text Data Augmentation with GAN  
- HW4 - LLM Fine-Tuning for Churn Prediction  
- HW5 - LLM + RAG (Web, PDF, and Dataset QA)  
- Final Project - Object Detection with YOLO  

## 🎞️ Final Project - Object Detection

Based on our own retraining process and dataset, inspired by:  
[achen353/Taiwanese-Traffic-Object-Detection](https://github.com/achen353/Taiwanese-Traffic-Object-Detection)

> The structure and major steps are largely based on the reference repository.  
> We learned a lot from their setup and adapted it to train our own models using custom data.

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is **a work in progress** and may continue to be updated.
- Everyone is **welcome to explore, use, or modify** the code for learning and educational purposes.
- Some parts of the code are adapted from **teaching assistants** and **open-source resources**.
