# HW1 - Association Rules, Clustering, and Classification

This assignment explores traditional machine learning methods including association rule mining, clustering, and classification using both Weka and Python.

## üîç Topics Covered

### Association Rule Mining
- **Algorithm**: Apriori
- **Metrics**: Support, Confidence, Lift
- **Tools**: Weka (Supermarket dataset), Python (Red Wine Quality dataset)
- **Insights**:
  - High volatile acidity often correlates with low citric acid
  - Low citric acid relates to mid-to-high fixed acidity
  - Lift values confirmed strong associations

### Clustering
- **Methods**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- **Tools**: Weka and Python
- **Approach**: Feature selection based on association rule strength
- **Findings**:
  - Weka yielded more accurate clustering results compared to Python

### Classification
- **Algorithms**: ID3 (Python), J48 (Weka), Random Forest
- **Comparison**:
  - Weka showed higher accuracy in classification
  - Python allowed feature importance visualization
  - Decision trees had minor branching differences between platforms
