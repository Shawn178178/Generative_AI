# HW2 - CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNNs

This assignment focuses on image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset and compares performance across several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.

## 🖼 Dataset
- **Source**: CIFAR-10 (via Kaggle and Keras)
- **Size**: 50,000 training images, 300,000 test images
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Used `py7zr` to decompress `.7z` files
  - Switched to `tensorflow.keras.datasets` for convenience
  - Adjusted labels from binary to categorical

## 🧠 Models Compared

### Model 1: Basic CNN
- Simple structure
- Used as baseline for comparison

### Model 2: Deep CNN with Dropout
- Added convolutional/pooling layers and dropout
- Achieved better accuracy and faster convergence

### Model 3: VGG16
- Predefined deep architecture
- Training accuracy improved steadily, but not significantly better than Model 2

## ⚙ Training Settings
- **Optimizer**: Adam (also tested AdamW)
- **Epochs**: 10 and 20
- **Learning Rates**: 0.001 and 0.01
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Input Shape**: (32, 32) for CIFAR-10

## 📊 Key Observations
- Model 2 performed best overall
- Model 1 improved with higher learning rate
- VGG16 didn’t outperform custom models despite deeper layers
