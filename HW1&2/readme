## 📗 HW2 - CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Deep Learning

### Dataset
- **Source**: CIFAR-10 (via Kaggle and Keras)
- **Preprocessing**: Used `py7zr` for decompression and also tested with Keras built-in dataset.

### Models Compared
1. **Model 1**: Simple CNN
2. **Model 2**: Deeper CNN with Dropout
3. **Model 3**: VGG16

### Training Details
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 10 & 20
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 & 0.01

### Findings
- Model 2 had better performance and convergence.
- VGG16 did not outperform custom CNNs significantly on CIFAR-10.
